# hello-world

Thanks

I'm learning to use github in an effort to better understand webhooks through discord.  With that information I'll be able to better serve the homeshcool group that I organize.  I have virtually no experience with coding and don't know what I'm doing but I'm hopeful that I'll be able to learn with a little effort.
